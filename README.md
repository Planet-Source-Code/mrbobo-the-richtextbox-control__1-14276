## The RichTextBox Control


</div>

### Description

I keep reading requests for RichtextBox code on PSC so I decided to upload one of my templates with a few added features. Nothing that special here really - basic RichtextBox functioality. The RichtextBox is pretty good at what it does though !

This example demonstrates :

Find and Replace,

Infinite Undo/Redo,

Using .tmp files,

HighLighting selected words,

Inserting Images,

Inserting text at a set location with different Fonts,

Common Editing Functions,

Shrinking a path to a desired length,

Creating your own light-weight Wizard.

This is not meant to be a complete application merely a demonstation of some techniques.

All error messages and bugs are provided entirely free of charge. Feel free to use any of the code or errors as you wish - MS wrote the control - I've just shown how you might use it. It's capable of more than I've shown here.
